## Jenny's Project

Hey Jenny, How is it going?
As a newbie developer it was great. Well done :)
I added some comments for you, hope will help you to make your project better.
If you had any question or comment, you know Where I am, feel free to ask.

In the root directory, Install the dependencies by:
### `yarn` or `yarn add`

After installing the packages you can run the project:
### `yarn start`


**Note: Did it very fast! hope it's alright.**
